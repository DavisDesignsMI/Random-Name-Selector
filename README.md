# Random-Name-Selector
Allows the user to input a set of names/words and output them in random order.

I would greatly appreciate it if anyone who uses this software gives me some credit.  I am a new programmer
trying to spread my influence/name recognition and portfolio, so attributing me is greatly helpful, but not necessary!
